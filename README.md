# NestJS MCP Server

This project is a NestJS-based server implementation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a robust and scalable backend for agents to discover and interact with various tools via a standardized API.

## Description

This is a NestJS framework TypeScript starter repository, extended to function as an MCP server. It allows for the registration and execution of various tools, exposing them via HTTP endpoints. The server supports both standard request/response and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming tool outputs.

## Features

- **Tool Management**: Register and expose custom tools.
- **Standardized API**: Interact with tools via defined MCP endpoints.
- **Streaming Support**: Utilize Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time tool output.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new tools by implementing the `McpTool` interface.

## Project setup

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod

# start with stdio transport
$ pnpm run start:stdio

# start with http transport
$ pnpm run start:http
```

## API Endpoints

The server exposes the following MCP-related endpoints:

- `GET /mcp/server-info`: Get basic server information and capabilities.
- `GET /mcp/tools`: List all available tool definitions.
- `POST /mcp/tool/call`: Call a specific tool with arguments. Supports SSE for streaming responses.

## Implemented Tools

The following tools are currently implemented and available:

- `file-search`: Search for files within the project directory.
- `filereader`: Read the content of a specified file.
- `ping`: A simple tool for testing connectivity.

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool:

1. Create a new module and service under `src/tools`.
2. Implement the `McpTool` interface in your service.
3. Register your tool in `src/mcp/mcp.module.ts` by providing it to the `MCP_TOOLS` injection token.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ pnpm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
